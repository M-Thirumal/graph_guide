#### What is Graphs?

Graphs are a very natural way to think about information and especially about the representation of our world 

Graphs consist of nodes[Vertices] and edges.

##### Vertices - Domain Entities (things, events, concepts)
 * Label - type (Eg: Person, product)
 * Properties - attribute or metadata (Eg: name, price)
  
##### Edges - relationship

 * Label - semantic/relationship type
 * Properties - attribute or metadata (Eg: strength, weight, quality, metadata)

####  How it works?

* Edges connect vertices (nodes)
* Every edge has a direction and a label
* Queries are expressed as traversal from vertex to vertex via edges

##### <U>RDF Graph:-</U>

RDF graph in some way it's a pure graph, it has nothing but vertices and edges.  
An `RDF graph` is a `directed, labeled (DLG)` 
  * Works in a sort of Object oriented passion, so we can introduce a class `type`
  * Polymorphism and reasoning
        ![img/RDF-infer.png](img/RDF-infer.png)
  * We can infer the data from existing node/Vertices
  * Nodes & Edges are named using URIs for machine readability
